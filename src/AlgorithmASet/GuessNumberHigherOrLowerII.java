/*
	We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
	
	I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
	
	Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
	
	However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
	
	Example:
	
	n = 10, I pick 8.
	
	First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
	Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
	Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
	
	Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
	
	You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
	
	Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
